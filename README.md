An implementation of the [Apache Ossie](https://github.com/apache/ossie)
semantic model standard for [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/docs). It reads an Ossie description of
your data, answers questions asked in business terms (metrics by
dimensions, with conditions) with one ClickHouse query, and serves the
description and the queries to AI agents over [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), the
Model Context Protocol.

## Why

A company connects an AI assistant to its database and the assistant gets
things wrong: hundreds of tables with no explanations, three columns with
the same name, a different "revenue" in every department. Apache Ossie
fixes this at the level of description: one open, portable definition of
what tables and fields mean, how they relate and how metrics are computed.
dactopus-ossie-clickhouse executes those descriptions on ClickHouse, which the
standard does not cover itself, and handles the ClickHouse specifics
(tables that keep change history, reference data in dictionaries, join
resolution) so that neither the model author nor the agent has to.

## Install

Python 3.11 or later. Not on PyPI yet: the `apache-ossie` package this
builds on is a git dependency until upstream publishes it, and PyPI does
not accept packages with git dependencies.

```bash
pip install "dactopus-ossie-clickhouse[mcp] @ git+https://github.com/Dactopus/dactopus-ossie-clickhouse"
```

Leave out `[mcp]` to skip the MCP server and its SDK; the library and the
CLI work without them.

Until 0.4.0 the package and its command were `ossie-clickhouse` and the
module `ossie_clickhouse`; the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) says what to
change.

## Quick start

Point it at a model and a ClickHouse. The
[TPC-DS reference model](https://github.com/apache/ossie/blob/main/examples/tpcds_semantic_model.yaml)
from the Ossie repository is in [tests/fixtures/tpcds.yaml](tests/fixtures/tpcds.yaml).
ClickHouse credentials go in the URL or in `OSSIE_CLICKHOUSE_URL`
(default `http://127.0.0.1:8123`). A database in the URL path
(`.../analytics`) is where a model's sources without a database are read.

```bash
dactopus-ossie-clickhouse validate model.yaml --url http://user:password@host:8123
dactopus-ossie-clickhouse sql model.yaml -m total_sales -d item.i_brand -w "date_dim.d_year = 1998"
dactopus-ossie-clickhouse query model.yaml -m total_sales -d item.i_brand --having "total_sales > 1000000" --json
dactopus-ossie-clickhouse serve model.yaml        # MCP over stdio, see docs/mcp-setup.md
```

From Python:

```python
from dactopus_ossie_clickhouse import load_model
from dactopus_ossie_clickhouse.executor import Executor, connect
from dactopus_ossie_clickhouse.planner import Query

ex = Executor(connect("http://user:password@host:8123"), load_model("model.yaml"))
r = ex.execute(Query(measures=("total_sales",), dimensions=("item.i_brand",)))
print(r.sql, r.columns, r.rows[:3])
```

That is the Python API: `load_model`, `executor.connect`,
`executor.Executor`, `planner.Query` and `planner.Order`; a `PlanError`
carries a `code` and `suggestions` and names the nearest known object. The
other modules are internal.

## The query

A question is the aggregation query of Ossie's Layer 3 draft,
[apache/ossie#246](https://github.com/apache/ossie/pull/246) §5.1.1
(revision `cc0d070`, not yet merged): `measures` (metric names),
`dimensions` (`dataset.field`), `where`, `having`, `order_by`, `limit`.
Over MCP it is one JSON object:

```json
{"measures": ["total_sales"], "dimensions": ["item.i_brand"],
 "where": "date_dim.d_year = 1998", "having": "total_sales > 1000000",
 "order_by": [{"field": "total_sales", "direction": "DESC"}], "limit": 10}
```

A refused question carries a code: #246's where one applies
(`E_NAME_NOT_FOUND`, `E_NO_PATH`, `E_AGGREGATE_IN_WHERE` and others),
otherwise one of the common codes of the `execute_query` profile draft,
[apache/ossie#529](https://github.com/apache/ossie/pull/529)
(`QUERY_INVALID`, `UNSUPPORTED_QUERY`, `BACKEND_ERROR`). Not supported
yet, refused with `UNSUPPORTED_QUERY`: scalar queries (`fields`), ad-hoc
aggregates in `measures`, and the questions #246 answers by aggregating
facts separately and combining them.

## How a question becomes SQL

Click the diagram for the [interactive version](https://dactopus.github.io/dactopus-ossie-clickhouse/):
one question from an agent followed to its SQL, line by line, and two
questions it refuses.

- Datasets come from `source`, joins from `relationships`. One root
  dataset, `LEFT JOIN` to the dimensions the question touches, only along
  relationships whose `to_columns` cover a primary or unique key of the
  target (many-to-one). `SETTINGS`
  [`join_use_nulls = 1`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/operations/settings/settings#join_use_nulls)
  so unmatched rows get NULL, not ClickHouse defaults.
- `where` conditions over fields become `WHERE`; `having` conditions over
  metric names, aggregates (`total_sales > 1000000`) and the question's
  own dimensions become `HAVING`. A condition in the wrong clause is
  refused with #246's code. A window metric (`RANK() OVER ...`) cannot be
  filtered: select it and filter the rows. A condition is one expression,
  never a statement, and its functions reach ClickHouse as written: what a
  caller may run there is decided by ClickHouse grants and quotas, not by
  this library.
- Tables with a [`ReplacingMergeTree`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/replacingmergetree)
  engine, replicated or on ClickHouse Cloud, and `Distributed` tables,
  materialized views and `Merge` tables over them, are read with [`FINAL`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/statements/select/from#final-modifier);
  single-key [dictionaries](https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/dictionaries) are read with
  `dictGetOrNull` instead of a join. Both are learned from `system.tables`
  and `system.dictionaries`, not configured.
- Expressions in `OSSIE_SQL_2026` or `ANSI_SQL` are translated on the
  [SQLGlot](https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot) AST; the spec's function
  catalog is mapped to ClickHouse equivalents and checked by value against
  [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org) and the spec text.
- Rows come sorted by the first metric, descending, with rows without a
  value (NULL) last, unless `order_by` says otherwise, so the top rows come
  first and nobody has to rank them by hand. An explicit `order_by`
  follows #246: NULL sorts as the highest value, first descending, unless
  the entry's `nulls` says `LAST` (a key of this project: #246 gives the
  object form none).
- Names resolve case-insensitively; SQL uses the physical names as the
  model writes them. The same question and model always give the same SQL.
- Refusals name the nearest known metric, field or dataset, in the text
  and as suggestions, so an agent can recover from a typo without help.

## CLI

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `validate <model> [--url]` | Check the file; with `--url`, also that every source, column and relationship column exists in ClickHouse. |
| `sql <model> ...` | Print the SQL for a question without running it. |
| `query <model> ... [--json]` | Run it; TSV or JSON rows. |
| `serve <model>` | MCP server over stdio (needs the `[mcp]` extra). |

Question options for `sql` and `query`: `-m metric` (repeatable),
`-d dataset.field` (repeatable), `-w condition` and `--having condition`
(repeatable), `-o "name [desc] [nulls first|last]"` (repeatable),
`-l limit`. A refusal prints its code: `error: E_NAME_NOT_FOUND: ...`.
`--url` and `--policy` apply to anything that talks to ClickHouse.

## Documentation

- [Model authoring for ClickHouse](docs/model-authoring.md): sources,
  keys, expressions, deduplication, dictionaries, validation.
- [Access control](docs/access-control.md): ClickHouse users, roles and
  row policies decide; the policy file hides more.
- [MCP setup](docs/mcp-setup.md): Claude Desktop, Claude Code and other
  stdio MCP clients.
- [Design decisions](docs/design.md): what was measured or evaluated, and
  the remote server design that waits for demand.
- [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) and [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## What it is not

No chat, no charts, no user interface: it provides access and
understanding, the interface is someone else's job. No data loading: the
data must already be in ClickHouse.

## Limits

- One root dataset per question, with direct relationships to every
  dataset it touches. Chains through an intermediate dataset and
  questions across two fact tables are not supported.
- Metrics are computed over the root's rows. A question whose metric
  would count a joined dataset's rows repeatedly, or only those the root
  references, is refused with a message, not answered with a wrong
  number; see [model authoring](docs/model-authoring.md#keys-decide-which-joins-are-allowed).
- Joins are many-to-one only, inferred from primary and unique keys.
- No time grain and no derived-dimension syntax: declare a field per
  grain or band (see [model authoring](docs/model-authoring.md)). The
  spec has no such attributes yet, and this project does not invent them.
- A metric cannot reference another metric by name; repeat the expression.

## Status

Pre-release. The supported Ossie schema version is pinned (`0.2.0.dev0`)
and checked on load, because the standard is still moving. Tested against
the TPC-DS reference model on ClickHouse 26.x. Until the major version is
1, a minor release may change the Python API; the CLI and the MCP tools
are the stable surface.

Where it goes from here: PyPI once `apache-ossie` is published there; the
upstream Ossie SQL dialect and compliance suite once they merge; multi-fact
questions, fan-out protection for one-to-many joins, `source` as a query
and a remote multi-user MCP server on the first real request. Ask for one
in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Dactopus/dactopus-ossie-clickhouse/issues).

[`research/`](research/) holds the experiments behind some decisions in this
code and the data we share with the Apache Ossie community; nothing there is
part of the library.
