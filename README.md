# ossie-clickhouse

An implementation of the [Apache Ossie](https://github.com/apache/ossie)
semantic model standard for [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/docs). It reads an Ossie description of
your data, answers questions asked in business terms (metrics, dimensions,
filters) with one ClickHouse query, and serves the description and the
queries to AI agents over [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), the
Model Context Protocol.

## Why

A company connects an AI assistant to its database and the assistant gets
things wrong: hundreds of tables with no explanations, three columns with
the same name, a different "revenue" in every department. Apache Ossie
fixes this at the level of description: one open, portable definition of
what tables and fields mean, how they relate and how metrics are computed.
ossie-clickhouse executes those descriptions on ClickHouse, which the
standard does not cover itself, and handles the ClickHouse specifics
(tables that keep change history, reference data in dictionaries, join
resolution) so that neither the model author nor the agent has to.

## Install

Python 3.11 or later. Not on PyPI yet: the `apache-ossie` package this
builds on is a git dependency until upstream publishes it, and PyPI does
not accept packages with git dependencies.

```bash
pip install "ossie-clickhouse[mcp] @ git+https://github.com/Dactopus/ossie-clickhouse"
```

Leave out `[mcp]` to skip the MCP server and its SDK; the library and the
CLI work without them.

## Quick start

Point it at a model and a ClickHouse. The
[TPC-DS reference model](https://github.com/apache/ossie/blob/main/examples/tpcds_semantic_model.yaml)
from the Ossie repository is in [tests/fixtures/tpcds.yaml](tests/fixtures/tpcds.yaml).
ClickHouse credentials go in the URL or in `OSSIE_CLICKHOUSE_URL`
(default `http://127.0.0.1:8123`).

```bash
ossie-clickhouse validate model.yaml --url http://user:password@host:8123
ossie-clickhouse sql model.yaml -m total_sales -d item.i_brand -f "date_dim.d_year = 1998"
ossie-clickhouse query model.yaml -m total_sales -d item.i_brand -f "total_sales > 1000000" --json
ossie-clickhouse serve model.yaml        # MCP over stdio, see docs/mcp-setup.md
```

From Python:

```python
from ossie_clickhouse import load_model
from ossie_clickhouse.executor import Executor, connect
from ossie_clickhouse.planner import Query

ex = Executor(connect("http://user:password@host:8123"), load_model("model.yaml"))
r = ex.execute(Query(metrics=("total_sales",), dimensions=("item.i_brand",)))
print(r.sql, r.columns, r.rows[:3])
```

That is the Python API: `load_model`, `executor.connect`,
`executor.Executor` and `planner.Query`; a `PlanError` names the nearest
known object. The other modules are internal.

## How a question becomes SQL

- Datasets come from `source`, joins from `relationships`. One root
  dataset, `LEFT JOIN` to the dimensions the question touches, only along
  relationships whose `to_columns` are a primary or unique key of the
  target (many-to-one). `SETTINGS`
  [`join_use_nulls = 1`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/operations/settings/settings#join_use_nulls)
  so unmatched rows get NULL, not ClickHouse defaults.
- Filters over fields go to `WHERE`; filters that name a metric or contain
  an aggregate (`total_sales > 1000000`) go to `HAVING`, and may only use
  the question's own dimensions besides aggregates. A window metric
  (`RANK() OVER ...`) cannot be filtered: select it and filter the rows.
  A filter is one expression, never a statement, and its functions reach
  ClickHouse as written: what a caller may run there is decided by
  ClickHouse grants and quotas, not by this library.
- Tables with a [`Replacing*`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/replacingmergetree)
  engine are read with [`FINAL`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/statements/select/from#final-modifier);
  single-key [dictionaries](https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/dictionaries) are read with
  `dictGetOrNull` instead of a join. Both are learned from `system.tables`
  and `system.dictionaries`, not configured.
- Expressions in `OSSIE_SQL_2026` or `ANSI_SQL` are translated on the
  [SQLGlot](https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot) AST; the spec's function
  catalog is mapped to ClickHouse equivalents and checked by value against
  [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org) and the spec text.
- Rows come sorted by the first metric, descending, unless `order_by` says
  otherwise, so the top rows come first and nobody has to rank them by hand.
  Rows without a value (NULL) come last in either direction.
- Names resolve case-insensitively; SQL uses the physical names as the
  model writes them. The same question and model always give the same SQL.
- Errors name the nearest known metric, field or dataset, so an agent can
  recover from a typo without help.

## CLI

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `validate <model> [--url]` | Check the file; with `--url`, also that every source, column and relationship column exists in ClickHouse. |
| `sql <model> ...` | Print the SQL for a question without running it. |
| `query <model> ... [--json]` | Run it; TSV or JSON rows. |
| `serve <model>` | MCP server over stdio (needs the `[mcp]` extra). |

Question options for `sql` and `query`: `-m metric` (repeatable),
`-d dataset.field` (repeatable), `-f condition` (repeatable; a metric
name or an aggregate means `HAVING`), `-o "name [desc]"`, `-l limit`.
`--url` and `--policy` apply to anything that talks to ClickHouse.

## Documentation

- [Model authoring for ClickHouse](docs/model-authoring.md): sources,
  keys, expressions, deduplication, dictionaries, validation.
- [Access control](docs/access-control.md): ClickHouse users, roles and
  row policies decide; the policy file hides more.
- [MCP setup](docs/mcp-setup.md): Claude Desktop, Claude Code and other
  stdio MCP clients.
- [Design decisions](docs/design.md): what was measured or evaluated, and
  the remote server design that waits for demand.
- [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) and [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## What it is not

No chat, no charts, no user interface: it provides access and
understanding, the interface is someone else's job. No data loading: the
data must already be in ClickHouse.

## Limits

- One root dataset per question, with direct relationships to every
  dataset it touches. Chains through an intermediate dataset and
  questions across two fact tables are not supported.
- Joins are many-to-one only, inferred from primary and unique keys.
- No time grain and no derived-dimension syntax: declare a field per
  grain or band (see [model authoring](docs/model-authoring.md)). The
  spec has no such attributes yet, and this project does not invent them.
- A metric cannot reference another metric by name; repeat the expression.

## Status

Pre-release. The supported Ossie schema version is pinned (`0.2.0.dev0`)
and checked on load, because the standard is still moving. Tested against
the TPC-DS reference model on ClickHouse 26.x. Until the major version is
1, a minor release may change the Python API; the CLI and the MCP tools
are the stable surface.

Where it goes from here: PyPI once `apache-ossie` is published there; the
upstream Ossie SQL dialect and compliance suite once they merge; multi-fact
questions, fan-out protection for one-to-many joins, `source` as a query
and a remote multi-user MCP server on the first real request. Ask for one
in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Dactopus/ossie-clickhouse/issues).

[`research/`](research/) holds the experiments behind some decisions in this
code and the data we share with the Apache Ossie community; nothing there is
part of the library.
